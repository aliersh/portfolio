            I started my career as a biochemical engineer, where I learned a
            systematic approach to tackling problems. Along the way, I developed
            a genuine interest in web development, focusing on tools like React,
            Next.js, and Astro to build clean, user-friendly websites.

            Currently, I’m working on an ecommerce platform for a local produce
            delivery service. I enjoy the balance of functionality, performance,
            and good design, and I’m always finding new ways to improve my code.
            If you’d like to see more of what I’m working on or think we could
            collaborate, feel free to reach out.
